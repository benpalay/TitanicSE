We then calculate the accuracy of each model for the TRAINING set data. In other words we  determine how accurate each model is when it is asked to predict the outcome  (survival)  for the passengers on which it was trained. High scores might be an inidcation of which algorithms are likely to work well for predicting survival for passenges in the test set(this is the ultimate goal), although high scores could also indicate overfitting which is bad .
